    <p>The <strong>Summary Report</strong> presents an aggregate view of the selected block groups: there is one record for each summary metric.  The source of the data in this tab is the Census 2010.</p>

	<p>By clicking on a row you can highlight the individual row.</p>
	
	<p>Clicking the <strong>Use Comparison</strong> box will bring up a drop down list showing values that can be used to compare with selected data.</p>

	<p>The <strong>Summary Report</strong> can be exported to an Excel or CVS data file using the <strong>Export Results</strong> selector and button.</p>

	<p>For the Council of Government / Metropolitan Planning Organization layer, the ACS 2014 data was interpolated down to census blocks and allocated to the appropriate geometry using a winner takes all method where the block data would go to the geometry in which the centroid of the block was contained.  These numbers were rounded and may not always add up exactly to 100% as expected.</p>
