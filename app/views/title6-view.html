This Provision stipulates that the targeted minimum number of recipients regarding the translation of written materials for LEP populations is five percent or 1,000 persons, whichever is less, of the total population of persons eligible to be served. Thus for determining the number of affected Census Blocks and affected population, 5% is used as the guideline rather than the MPO percentage.</p> -->
            <p class='legal'><sup>d</sup> The guidance for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) for DOT recipients refers to persons age 5 years and over who speak english less than "very well." See <a class="link" href="http://www.lep.gov/guidance/guidance_Fed_Guidance.html">http://www.lep.gov/guidance/guidance_Fed_Guidance.html</a> Data from 2015 ACS 5-Year estimates (Table B16005). 2015 estimate of total persons age 5 years and over for the defined geography is <span class="pop5PlusFootnote" style="all: unset;"></span>.</p>
            <p class='legal'><sup>e</sup> Affected population is the total of people that fall into the specified category for all Census blocks that have greater than or equal to the percentage for the MPO area (as defined by the Census geography, see note f).</p>
            <p class='legal'><sup>f</sup> The data used in this analysis are generated using an enhanced method of interpolation based on the ACS 2015 block groups and using the 2010 Census block data.  In order to approximate the population, housing and workforce data for these custom areas, the following enhanced method was used:
                <ul class='legal'>
                    <li>The counts are redistributed to a more detailed geography (Census Block Group data or Census Tracts), that better nests within the MPO boundaries. </li>
                    <li>The counts are proportionally redistributed to blocks based on the Census 2010 counts for population, households or housing units.</li>
                    <li>The blocks are then assigned to the MPO containing their center, and summed by the MPO, to obtain the final counts.</li>
