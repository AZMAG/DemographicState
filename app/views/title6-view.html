	<p class='legal'><sup>a</sup> Minority includes total population less White (Non Hispanic). Data for minority and population groups by age are from 2010 Census data.</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>b</sup> Percent of the population for whom poverty status is determined does not include institutionalized persons or persons under 5 years of age. Total population in the Census defined MPO area for whom poverty status is determined is 89,355.  Data from 2014 ACS 5-Year estimates (Table B17001)</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>c</sup> Disability status from the 2014 ACS 5-year estimates.  All percentages are based on Census Tracts that match as close as possible to the MPO area, see note 'g'.  Disability status is determined for the civilian noninstitutionalized population based on six types of difficulty: hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living difficulty. (Table B18101)</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>d</sup> For Limited English Proficient (LEP) persons, the Federal guidance (Federal Transit Administration Circular 4702.1B) notes that DOT has adopted the DOJ's Safe Harbor Provision. This Provision stipulates that the targeted minimum number of recipients regarding the translation of written materials for LEP populations is five percent or 1,000 persons, whichever is less, of the total population of persons eligible to be served. Thus for determining the number of affected Census Tracts and affected population, 5% is used as the guideline rather than the MPO percentage.</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>e</sup> Affected population is the total of people that fall into the specified category for all Census tracts that have greater than or equal to the percentage for the MPO area (as defined by the Census geography, see note h) or as designated for LEP populations (see note e).</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>f</sup> The guidance for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) for DOT recipients refers to persons age 5 years and over who speak english less than "very well."  See http://www.lep.gov/guidance/guidance_Fed_Guidance.html    Data from 2014 ACS 5-Year estimates (Table B16005).  2014 estimate of total persons age 5 years and over for the defined Census geography is 86,678.</p>
	<p class='legal'><sup>g</sup> The Census Tracts used in this analysis include the best match using full Census Tracts where the majority of the population or the tract centroid is within the MPO boundary.   The base numbers for all values in this table are for this Census-based defined area.</p>
